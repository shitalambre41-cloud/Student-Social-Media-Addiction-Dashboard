# Student-Social-Media-Addiction-Dashboard
This Tableau project analyzes social media addiction among students across different demographic and academic categories. The dashboard provides an interactive, multi-view analysis to understand usage behavior, addiction levels, mental health impact, and platform preferences.

Key Components of the Dashboard

1. Academic Level vs. Average Addiction Score
A stacked bar visualization shows the average social media addiction score among:
High School students
Undergraduate students
Graduate students
Each bar highlights which platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, Twitter, WhatsApp, YouTube) are influencing addiction in each academic category.

2. Platform Filter & Mental Health Slider
A checkbox filter lets users select one or multiple social media platforms to dynamically update the dashboard.
A Mental Health Score slider allows filtering students based on their mental health scale (66–1525).
Helps identify how social media usage correlates with mental well-being.

3. Student Demographic Table
Displays Student ID, gender, and age.
Used for drilling down into raw individual-level data.

4. Relationship Status Analysis (Pie Chart)
Shows distribution of students based on:
Single
In Relationship
Complicated
Helps compare if relationship status has any link with addiction levels.

5. Mental Health vs. Daily Usage (Scatter Plot)
Plots Mental Health Score vs. Average Daily Social Media Hours.
Highlights behavior patterns such as:
High usage leading to lower or higher mental health values
Outliers representing extreme addiction or healthier balance

6. Country-Wise Average Usage (Bar Chart)
Displays the average daily usage hours across different countries such as:
Canada, Denmark, France, India, Ireland, Mexico, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, USA
Helps compare global social media usage trends among students.

🎯Purpose of the Project
Analyze social media addiction levels in students.
Study the impact of different platforms on addiction.
